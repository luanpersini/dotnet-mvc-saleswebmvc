# Description

Project based in the course https://www.udemy.com/course/programacao-orientada-a-objetos-csharp / https://github.com/acenelio/workshop-asp-net-core-mvc that uses .Net 2.1.

My project has the following changes:

- Using .Net 6.0 instead of .Net 2.1
- Added Repositories
- Using Interfaces for Services and Repositories
- Using SelectListItem + ViewBag instead of ViewModel classes with the intent of populating view info.
